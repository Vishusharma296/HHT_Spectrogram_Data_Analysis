# Student research Project

Title: Spectral Analysis of Non-linear, Non-stationary Time Series Data Using Hilbert-Huang Transform and Spectrogram.

The Objective of the research done in this student research project was:

- To deeply undertand the Fourier Spectral analysis (FFT + Spectrogram) and able to write codes for FSA in Matlab and Python.
- To understand the working , limitations and strengths of the Spectrogram and able to write codes for FSA in Matlab and Python.
- To understand the working of the Hilbert Huang Transform and able to write codes for analysis in Matlab and Python
- To apply these methods to artificial as well as natural time series signals to generate insights
- Performance comparisons of both the algorithms 
- Finding out about the limitations and recent research in HHT
- Apply these methods to sensor data from offshore Wind Turbines 

### Data Sets from Wind Turbine

Data sets of natural signals were obtained from In-Situ-Wind project of SHM department of University of Siegen. 
The datasets were meant to be used for student research project only.
They were obtained by the permission of Prof. Dr-Ing Peter Kreamer.

This repository contains:

CSVs extracted from two large Data Structure in Matlab files/tables 
- Latex source file of the report
- Research Papers and Books
- Matlab codes used in analysis
- Jupyter notebooks written for data analysis in python
- Images of the data analysis results
- Notes - Presentations and scanned
- CSV files from Wind Turbine data
These CSVs comprises of following sensor data:

- D1--- Data set 1, obtained on 24-01-2022
- D2--- Data set 2, obtained on 29-01-2022

-> Acc---Acclerometer data
-> DMS---Strain gauge data
-> INC--- Inclination data
-> Temp--- Temperature data
-> EOC--- Environmental operating conditions data

Only specific parts of the datasturcture were converted and extracted into CSVs 
They were later analysed by Hilbert Huang Transform and Spectrogram for a comparitive study
