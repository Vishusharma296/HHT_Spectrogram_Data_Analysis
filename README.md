Title: Spectral Analysis of Non-linear, Non-stationary Time Series Data Using Hilbert-Huang Transform and Spectrogram.

## Abstract

This research project aims to explore and compare the effectiveness of Fourier Spectral Analysis (FSA), including Fourier Transform and Spectrogram, alongside Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA) in analyzing non-linear and non-stationary time series signals. This research investigates the intricacies of FSA, HHT and HSA with an in depth discussion on their mathematical background, working and limitations with examples.

The research applies these methods/frameworks to analyse to both artificial and natural signals and extracts valuable insights by comparing the performance of the two frameworks. This research also delves into the limitations of traditional Fourier Spectral Analysis when dealing with non-stationary and non-linear signals and demonstrates the effectiveness of HHT in providing better time-frequency resolution. 

The research includes practical applications to real-world sensor data from off-shore wind turbines such as accelerometers, showcasing the potential application of these methods in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This research also scrutinizes the limitations of HHT and examines recent advancements in the field aimed at addressing these challenges. 

Key Words: Time Series, Fourier Spectral Analysis, Hilbert Huang Transform, Spectrogram, Empirical Mode Decomposition, Intrinsic Mode Functions.  

## Work Summary:

- To deeply understand the working, limitations and strengths of the Fourier Spectral analysis (FFT + Spectrogram) and able to write codes for FSA in Matlab and Python.
- To understand the working of the Hilbert Huang Transform and able to write codes for Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA) in Matlab and Python
- To apply these methods to artificial as well as natural time series signals to valuable generate insights
- Performance comparisons of both the algorithms / Frameworks. 
- Finding out about the limitations of HHT and recent research in HHT to overcome these shortcomings.
- Apply these methods to sensor data from offshore Wind Turbines (accelerometer, temperature, pressure sensors) and generate insights.

### Data Analysis of Artificially generated signal

FSA and HSA was applied to artificially generated signals. These signals were generated by a combination sinusoids.

### Analysis of sensors data from offshore wind turbines

Data sets of natural signals were obtained from In-Situ-Wind project of SHM department of University of Siegen. 
The datasets were meant to be used for student research project only. They were obtained by the permission of Prof. Dr-Ing Peter Kreamer.

### Main contents of the repository

- Matlab codes for data analysis (live script mlx files)
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis (python)
- Images of the data analysis results
- Latex source file of the report
- Research Papers and Books
- Notes - Presentations and scanned
- CSV files from Offshore-Wind Turbine data. These CSVs were extracted from two large Data Structures in Matlab files/tables. These CSVs contains the following sensor data:

- D1--- Data set 1, obtained on 24-01-2022
- D2--- Data set 2, obtained on 29-01-2022

- Acc---Acclerometer data
- DMS---Strain gauge data
- INC--- Inclination data
- Temp--- Temperature data
- EOC--- Environmental operating conditions data

Only relevant parts of the datasturcture were converted and extracted into CSVs. These files were later analysed by applying Hilbert Huang Transform and Spectrogram for a comparitive study.
